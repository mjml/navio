navio
=====

This is a small X11 program to help manage large numbers of desktop windows.

If you have 2+ monitors and work with many programs and terminals at once, alt-tabbing just doesn't cut it. Adding virtual desktops is a big help, but it isn't the whole solution. If you've often got more than four windows up, and just cycling between them is slow since their order is arbitrary.

The spatial locations of the windows is unrelated to their tab-switching order and so having to perform a "human linear search" for the right window is too clunky and slow.

This little program `navio` lets you use the Super_L key (windows key) and the WASD arrow keys to move up,left,down,right between your windows.
