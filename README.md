Navio
=====

This is a small X11 program that I wrote in order to help manage large numbers of desktop windows.

If you have 2+ monitors, Alt-Tabbing just doesn't cut it. Having multiple virtual desktops is a big help, but even there you've often got more than four windows up, and just cycling between them is slow since their order is arbitrary.

Often their left-to-right order is unrelated to their tab-switching order and having to perform a "human linear search" for the right window is too clunky and slow.

This little program `navio` lets you use the Super_L key (windows key) and the WASD arrow keys to move up,left,down,right between your windows. It has the smoothness and responsivity of a video game.
